Expression Comparator: Structural and Value-Based Analysis in Racket


This project focuses on comparing two expressions in Racket by evaluating their structure and values in a flexible and robust manner. The main goal seems to be comparing both simple values (numbers, booleans) and complex structures (lists, lambda expressions), handling different cases such as quoted expressions, if statements, and lambda bodies. The project also includes mechanisms for handling symbolic replacements within lambda expressions, allowing for parameter renaming
